# Multilabel_Image_Classification
Built a deep learning model to predict multiple fashion attributes from images using a pretrained ResNet18. Implemented masked binary cross-entropy to handle missing labels, fine-tuned the network on the dataset, visualized training loss, and created an inference pipeline to identify attributes present in new images.
